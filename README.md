This is my first Javascript project with tOP titled "Rock, Paper, Scissors" or, "rps" for short.
It is a sample HTML page with some basic CSS applied.
The Javascript is linked externally.

In the browser, the program produces a prompt that asks for one of three inputs, Rock, Paper or Scissors, and
then produces an alert message with the computer's choice and the result of the game.

For a look into how the program is structured, please see the notes contained in the script.js file.
